## Challenge: Delivering New Data Solutions to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes
Through its Decoding Maternal Morbidity Data Challenge, NICHD seeks innovative approaches to secondary analyses of data collected from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be [(nuMoM2b)](https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/study/226675). Using fresh and unique methods of computational analysis, data mining, or learning approaches, Challenge innovators can help identify factors and interventions that can reduce maternal morbidity and severe maternal morbidity.
<p> The goal of this Challenge is not to replicate prior findings but to focus on new discoveries using the data. Potential areas for exploration include prescription drug use; diet and nutrition; quality of healthcare including provider, insurance, or access to healthcare; risk factors for adverse outcomes; and the intersection of multiple factors. Because MM adversely impacts disadvantaged groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, at much higher rates than other groups, additional credit will be given to solutions addressing these communities. </p>

<p> Potential solutions should focus on drawing new or interesting associations from the nuMoM2b data that could inspire further research and intervention studies. Solutions could use established, new, or combinations of techniques to discover innovative outcomes. </p>

<p> There are no boundaries on the type of solution, but it must use the nuMoM2b dataset, be innovative, and have the potential to improve the lives of pregnant women and mothers. Comparison datasets can be used for analyses, but no attempt should be made to append data directly to the nuMoM2b dataset or identify study participants. </p>
